# What is Stockchimp?
Stockchump is a service created to help amateur investors find and discover new stocks in companies they haven't heard of before.

## How does it work?
A **future mobile app** will function in this way: you swipe left to add a stock to your watchlist, and swipe to add a stock to your reject list. The current proof-of-concept version of Stockchump attempts to recreate this using Python by allowing users to "swipe" left (l) and right (r) by inputting the letters when prompted.
